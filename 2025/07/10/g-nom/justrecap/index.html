Nym 871 After Chaos</h1><p>I have finally made it to a bigger city.. Lyon. I was taken aback at their restrictive life styles formed around the Segragation using<br>some for of plague given to one after a inspection by a Priest. Out of fear of my secret to be discovered in the inspection i decided<br>to create a plague myself. I have seen some commoners on my journey carrying one of those plaques so i was able to forge one myself. </p>
<p>Having arrived into Lyon by way of a Shippingvessle, i started my exploring from the habour. I started gathering information about the<br>local laws and state of technology. I was search for work near the trades distric of Lyon, i was able to gather some small amount of coin<br>in the first few days yet was not able to find a long term solution in the trades. Using my gold aquired in Stonevile i purchased some metal plate<br>with the goal of reinforcing my shabby protestic. One of the trades men owning a smithy was kind enough to allow me use his shop to<br>fit the plating to my arm. Thereafter being able to use my arm as a improvised shield. Sadly my time was restained and i didn’t have the<br>luxury to refine the shielding mechanism to the point i would have liked. This resulted in my mobuility being slightly restricted. </p>
<p>After gaining a foothold in the city the smith who was kind enough to let me use is facilities informed me if the local adventures guild and the<br>current existence of a quest that would be befitting of my skill. I registerd myself, trying to keep a low profile i did not inform them of<br>my former exploits and accepted my current rank to be the lowest “F”. I took up the quest the smith mentioned to me, sadly it was lack<br>any valuable information, which would mean gathering such. Not quiet my strength, but judging my the rumours around this quest forming a<br>party would be wise. Not long after which i stumbled into someone, well his singing stubmled into me first. But i was sure i remeber that<br>annoing voice. It was the bard Motlosi which acompanied me in Stonevile, beridding the mountainvillage of their Orc infestation.<br>Not having a better option and a bard being excatly what i needed i approached him. After a quick exchange of where we have been i<br>explained him my situation. And he his, seemingly he has drunken away a substantial amount of his reward in the past few weeks and is<br>also in need of a job and so he decided to join me. After which we started preparing and went to search for a few more additions to our party. </p>
<p>Not much more than a day after banding together we oberserved a queer party joining the guild with the goal of fullfiling the same quest.<br>We have had not much luck gaining more compainions being both obscure beings from far lands not trusted in these lands, so i decided to<br>approach this group. Things did not go as planned, being slightly tipsy myself and the bard having had more than anough liqure to kill a small beast, i started<br>talking which him i though would be their leader. A small but formitable looking Feline creature, i have heared of their kin bevor, but not much past their existence.<br>The party i approach was a weird bunch. It consistent of a staut Lizard womand looking after what i though was a drunk child. There was a for lacking of a better word<br>a burning woman carrying a small unmoving child. Maybe the others relative? And ofcourse the feline who i was talking to. After intruducing myself they did the same<br>and we started to discuss the boundaries of our potential collaboration. For some obsucre reason the Feline who i learned was named Stolas instited on the<br>drunk kid being the party leader. This kid named Alistar, seems more than incapable to me. Completly drunk beligerent.. though after almost eskalating to a fight i backed down<br>and agreed to join them given their boundaries. As a show of good intentions i proposed a fist fight with Stolas to mend potential ill emotions between us. As soon as<br>we agreed the mood in the Guild changed and started chanting for this fight. Which went worse than i had hoped. After we both were unable to land any proper blows<br>i felt something terrible grasp for my back which sent chills to my core. Disorented by this sudden attack i was wide open and Stolas lacerated my upper left leg. Badly bleading<br>i had to deescalte this fight. My best option would be to escalate and be separated. So i recalled my Trident and aimed it at Stolas, shortly after we were separted by the<br>many Mercinaries in the establishment. Motlosi later informed me that the Lizard woman Kaida had cast a spell targeting my back, not much honor in her body it seems. I should keep a eye<br>on her. I dont trust her. To cast a magic into someones back during a friendly sparring is beyond foul. But i have grown to like the Feline, he seems strong and capable.<br>I should try and gain his favour. Maybe through improving his current armour, which seemed lacking. </p>
<p>After this spectiacle at the Guild we decided to split up and gather information regarding this quest. I myself went to the central Library of Lyon, research about<br>my current affliction aswell as any mentions of this figure we are search for on the outskirts of Lyon. Sadly i did not find much. There was mention of someone who<br>can help with certain rare poinsons and ills. A person called the Soupdealer. I should find out more about this person. After finding our way back together we<br>exchanged the small amounts of information we had gatherd. None of us learning anything of substance. Well there was one thing, my companion Motlosi learned.<br>The person we though to be some Alistar, was infact some important prince Mearis. I did not know about him but juding by their defensiveness he sure seemed important.<br>He also seemed linked to this weird ailment from which im suffering form and which has exterminated my tribe. I should get close to him, i feel he is part of the<br>key to berid this world of the blight that has beset my tribe. </p>
<p>After gathering our resources we started the jounrey to the outer gates. Our plan was to camp in the Outskirts, keep an eye out for this figure. On the<br>was I learned that they knew of the creator of this being. A certain Healer? They informed me that he is a alchemist and kriminal. Bevor they joined the guild<br>they had apperently seized him and some of his equipment. Kaida, the shady Lizard gave a journal document some of the experiments performed, and each was worse<br>than the last. Having basic training in Alchemy I learned some about diffrent methods one can perform certain distilations but i did not learn much regarding my<br>curse or how to break it. </p>
<p>Once we made it to the Outskirts we set up camp and i started watch. Stolas mentioned that he felt a certain pull to cratures wearing the Alchemists neckless.<br>And acording to the rest of their party the creature we are hunting should wear one of them. We decided to wait it out and keep a tab on the movement of this<br>creature, but not make a move just yet. So we got ready for sleep. It seems that my suspicion that landbound creature need more rest was true, and all of them<br>rested for at least six hours. I took the first 4 hours of watch, during which not much notable happend. Zacharra joined me in the start but went to sleept after 2h.<br>Once the night grew old i awoke Stolas, who took watch after me and i started my rest. In the morning we all quickly got up and realised Stolas was missing. Motlosi<br>said something about him running in the direction of that creature. So we gatherd all our gear and followed his tracks. </p>
<h2 id="What-now"><a href="#What-now" class="headerlink" title="What now?"></a>What now?</h2><p>Looking into the future. I have gained some potential allies, though im not yet sure about their competence and if i can trust them.<br>I must look into getting closer to them to gain a better estimation of them. And even if they dont prove trustworthy they seem to be linked<br>to the Plague that has beset the Southern Waters and my Tribe. </p>
<p>I have also ready something about a Soup Dealer linked to healing a similar affliction as to mine. It might be worthywhile to ask around<br>for more information regarding this person. </p>
<p>Im also not happy with my current state of the prostetic arm. Its clunky and restricting my movement. I should explore options to<br>improve the make. </p>
